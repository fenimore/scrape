some scraps for scrapes and python 3 text/web manipulation

##For Craigslist
This bot scrapes for Free Stuff posting and posts the stuffs onto a map using Folium. After all for free stuff, distance is directly related to value. (Uses BeautifulSoup 4)

##For Le Bon Coin
This bot scrapes for low cost computers and then posts the latest annonces onto pump.io using PyPump. Uses sets to check for new entries, the bot runs on a While loop. (Uses BeautifulSoup 4)

##For Desktop Scraper
This very simple bot goes through simpledesktop.com's catalogue of simple desktop images, and downloads them into a folder. (Uses BeautifulSoup 4)

##For New York Times API
This bot is incomplete. The idea, however, is to get through the 10 article limit by asking for the keywords per day, then adding the different days into a total monthly/yearly csv. Would be nice to get Pandas in on this, but too lazy.

##Text Analysis
This is just some NLTK and TextBlob code for my reference.
